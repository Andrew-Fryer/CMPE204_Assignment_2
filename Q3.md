# Question 3

What should be on the quiz?

If you had control of building a quiz to assess knowledge of what the students in 204 learned for propositional semantics,
what question would you ask? Keep in mind that there are roughly 3-4 questions / quiz, and only 60min in total.

Only constraint is that you shouldn't just mirror one of the assignment or weekly practice questions. Try to be creative, and
the best questions very well may appear on a future quiz!

## Your answer below this line
"This course discussed a method for generating a CNF that has the behaviour described in a given truth table. The method involves writing one term per model for which the formula is false. There is a shorter/simpler way to write a CNF if the majority of the models give false. Write a CNF for the following truth table:
P Q R S T formula
T F F F T T
where all other rows give false." Ans: P&~Q&~R&~S&T

Alternatively, I have a cheeky answer:
"If you had control of building an assignment to assess knowledge of what the students in 204 learned for propositional semantics, what problem would you ask them to solve?"
